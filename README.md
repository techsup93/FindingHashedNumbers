# FindingHashedNumbers
Finding hashed numbers in a CSV dataset with a bottom-up approach
This project aims to demonstrate how to read and compare hashed CSV files using Python.

Steps

Step 0: Create a Sample Hashed CSV file 0-20
The first step is to generate a hashed CSV file containing numbers from 0 to 20. This step will create a file named "hashed.csv".

Step 1: Create a Sample Hashed CSV file Student Grades
The second step is to generate a hashed CSV file containing student grades. This step will create a file named "grades.csv".

Step 2: Read CSV Files
In the third step, the Python script will read the two CSV files generated in the previous steps and store their content in two separate lists.

Step 3: Compare CSV Files & Print
Finally, the script will compare the content of the two CSV files and print the similarity between them.
